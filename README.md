# Project 2 Space Shooter
9/28/2024
Created a space shooter using the assignments as a basis.
## Implementation
Used assignments as the base for this project. I found extra assets only on kenney.nl which include a new asteroid, ship, and background sprite. The ship sprite changes based on difficulty. The asset package was called "space shooter redux." There are three different difficulties which include easy normal and hard. On easy the player has more lives, a smaller hit box, slower enemy, but gains less points. On normal, the player has less lives, two enemies, and gains more points. On hard the play has only one life, two faster enemies, a bigger hitbox, and gains more points. This was my attempt at creating different levels.
